             Chat is something interesting topic in today’s era . 
             Everyone is busy chatting someone, now human is going to be lazy , he doesn’t want to interact directly with a human but he can get 
             that if he talks to someone by messaging and his problem solve so why unnecessary talk to a human, also one more reason behind,
             it that sometimes Everyone is busy like eating or some other work or holidays so that time is very useful, for removing all barrier to talk with the help of chatbot.

                As we said that we have built it from scratch so we used as Full Stack Development Technologies,
                here we started from backend because every application need strong foundation to built .In backend 
                we used Nodejs to run express libray to connect server and java script for coding .
                In this project we use reactjs for building front end of the application.
